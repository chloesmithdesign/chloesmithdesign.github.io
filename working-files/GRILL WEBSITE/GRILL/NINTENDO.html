  		You are standing in line for ice cream in your junior high school cafeteria.  All of the basketball players are hitting on the your dream chick and you’re way at the end of the line getting sweatpants pulled down by a black kid wearing an eyepatch and a sweatshirt that says “West Side”. You really need to win the affection of this chick, and it’ll all be for the better for the both of you in the long run. You’ll be making big bucks as an editor for GamePro magazine while all of those other Starter jersey-wearing preps will be sitting in gutters hitting each other up for “endo”.  
      <br><br>
      Pull out your sword and kill all of the basketball players in the area.  That way, when you run out of the cafeteria and then run back in, the basketball players will not all reappear. Use this opportunity to stab the kid who is left. Take his Charlotte Hornet jacket and trade it for an extra heart container, then give it to your dream chick. For extra points, kill the lunchlady too. Chicks dig murder.
