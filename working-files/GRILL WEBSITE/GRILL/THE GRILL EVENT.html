  		After coming to a two-way stop in the middle of nowhere, the urge was to head back to town However, Swiss Pope suggested going left, and Ghort relented. While travelling on, they eventually came to a small, beaten-up road leading off to the left.  Ghort backed up and pulled into the road. They discovered that they had pulled onto a cemetery road. Hardly disappointed, they drove around the unfenced graveyard and came to a stop in the corner closest to the road, but still very well concealed by trees. The four wanderers left the vehicle, and began a slow, but steady, exploration of the haunted grounds.
