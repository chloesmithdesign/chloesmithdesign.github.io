  		one of the other clear aspects of this movie is the fact that the males play the dominant role of the pride.  the females play the subservant, sumbissive, and workaholics.the male lion sits around all day, picking his ass, sleeping and basically making sure all the females are doing what they are supposed to be doing. the male gets as many woman as he wants. in fact, he could have up to 30 woman, and it would be alright.  in fact, not only alright, but it would be looked upon like you would be a great family, with political power.

      now, this is a time that is probably the most interesting.  first off, to getthis off my chest.  there would be no fucking way that a lion, which weights up to 400 pounds, could live off of insects! Okay, now that that is out ofthe way, lets get to the fun stuff.  This is said to be Simba’s homosexual lifestyle.  You see, Simba went through 3 changes in his life.  From asexual when he was young, homosexual when he was growing up (since his only friends were male, he had to relieve his sexual urges some way) and heterosexual when he finally meets up with Nala again. So, you see.. Simba didn’t leave the ordinary life. In fact, that is why he was so nice to everyone for awhile.  Until he learned that he can control who ever he wants, he didn’t know the taste of power.  But, he soon came to that realization.. he soon found his way as the King.
