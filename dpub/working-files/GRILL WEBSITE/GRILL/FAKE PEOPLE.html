  		The age-old adage “If you don’t have anything nice to say to someone, don’t say anything at all” is a huge bunch of bullshit made up by christian propagandists a great while ago merely to keep people oblivious to the world around them, and to keep anyone from rising up against their enslavers. Okay, so it might not have been the Christians’ fault, but SOME moron thought this idea was good.

      There is nothing I hate more than someone who interacts with me in a friendly way when I’m around them, and yet talks about me behind my back when I’m not. I can perhaps understand it from people who don’t really claim to like me, but merely would rather not offend me (There is still the fear factor involved, people are intimidated by me for some reason).  Sure, if you’re just nice so I won’t get mad at you, I can understand that. You’re still doing an ignorant thing, but at least you have somewhat of a reason.
