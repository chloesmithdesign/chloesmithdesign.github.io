  		Social media envy, if you’re among the 81% of young adults (18-24) that use Instagram daily you’ve definitely felt it. The constant stream of glossy perfectly posed candids of girls sitting among a field of flowers is enough to make anyone green, but how do they do it? The answer - a personal photographer by your side.
      <br> <br>
      Yes, Instagram beauties across the platform have been relying on their boyfriends’ as their personal photographers to achieve the perfect shot. But once hidden behind a lense these men no longer live in the shadows, thanks to the Instagram and Facebook accounts “Boyfriends of Instagram.” The pages post photos people have shared of boyfriends’ going to some pretty impressive lengths to photograph their girlfriends’. From sitting on each other’s shoulders to literally bending over backward, no shot is too much of a challenge. Created by two anonymous Australian men, the Instagram account has wracked up 137k followers.
