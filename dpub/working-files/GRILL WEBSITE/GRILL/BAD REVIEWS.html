  		The meal they gave me wasn’t what I ordered. I had ordered a roasted cauliflower and Brussel sprouts salad, but I received a hamburger and fries. I complained again about receiving the wrong order, and the waiter told me that’s all the food I was going to get. I took the bun off to find a raw lump of ground beef. It hadn’t even been cooked in the slightest! And upon closer  inspection, I saw maggots inside!
      <br><br>
      We complained to the waiter again and demanded to see the owner, so we could complain to him as well. The waiter responded by telling us he was the owner, and if we didn’t like the food, we could get the fuck off. Never in my life have I felt more obsure and shamed than from my experience within this restaurant.
