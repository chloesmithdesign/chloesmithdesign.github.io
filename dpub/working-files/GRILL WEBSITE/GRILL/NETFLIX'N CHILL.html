  		The internet has playfully dubbed the “Netflix and chill” button, and its arrival represents the next stage in the life of a phrase that began as simply an innocent way of saying, “I’ve had a hard day and all I want to do this evening is put on Netflix, curl up into the foetal position and consume four straight hours of visual entertainment”, but has become an innuendo (and a meme) for hooking up. 
      <br><br>
      In the innocent days of 2009, “Netflix and chill” really did mean “chilling out and watching Netflix”. It was a solo activity. There you were, sitting on your sofa, the latest season of whatever-it-is buzzing away in front of you, the “chill” part of the equation very much not a euphemism for anything at all. The phrase has since become a 21st-century version of “Do you want to come up for some coffee?” In April, it was added to Urban Dictionary with the definition: “Code for two people going to each others houses and fucking or doing other sexual related acts.”
